# ResNet on MNIST/FashionMNIST with PyTorch

## Overview

This repository contains code to replicate the ResNet architecture on the MNIST and FashionMNIST datasets using the PyTorch torchvision model. The approach involves reusing the torchvision ResNet model by splitting it into a feature extractor and a classifier. This allows for better customization and understanding of the ResNet architecture.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- See `requirements.txt` for specific versions of the required packages.

You can install the required packages using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Repository Structure

- `main.py`: The main script to train and evaluate the ResNet model on MNIST or FashionMNIST.
- `resnet_model.py`: Implementation of the ResNet model with the ability to split into a feature extractor and a classifier.
- `utils.py`: Utility functions for data loading, training, and evaluation.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python packages and versions used in this project.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/resnet-mnist.git
cd resnet-mnist
```

2. Install the required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the main script to train and evaluate the ResNet model:

```bash
python main.py --dataset mnist --epochs 10
```

Replace `mnist` with `fashionmnist` if you want to use the FashionMNIST dataset.

## Customization

Feel free to customize the ResNet architecture by modifying the `resnet_model.py` file. You can adjust the number of layers, channels, and other hyperparameters to suit your needs.
